Project is related to my Application's lab M.Tech 1st semester. 
Project uses the following : 
1. Arduino Uno
2. MFRC522 RFID module
3. LCD 16X2 with i2C adapter.
4. Servo motor with motor driver.

   Idea : RFID based access control system.
   (If RFID tag is scanned once, direction of rotation is clockwise, signalling the opening of door.
   Similarly , if RFID is scanned second time, the direction of rotation is anti-clockwise, meaning that the door is getting closed)
